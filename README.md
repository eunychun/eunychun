## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
Euny Chun is a UX designer,  dedicated to shaping a world more engaging and human centric. Fueled by curiosity, empathy, and collaboration, she's a problem-solver who enjoys creating optimal design solutions that harmonize user needs, business objectives, and technical feasibility. 

Iâ€™m currently working as a UX Designer at onsemi. Iâ€™m currently pursuing a master's degree in User Experience at ASU and after I graduate I hope to work as UX Designer to apply what I've learned to my work. 

Outside of work, baking is more than just a hobby â€“ itâ€™s a way for me to share joy through sweet treats and find a perfect escape from any stressful moments. Additionally, I love camping and immersing myself in nature. Whether at home or in the office, I find inspiration in the scenes outside my window.
